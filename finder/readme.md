# Finder

> The Finder is the default file manager on macOS. It is responsible for the launching of other applications, and for the overall user management of files, disks, and network volumes. In a tradition dating back to the Classic Mac OS of the 1980s and 1990s, the Finder icon is the smiling screen of a computer, known as the Happy Mac logo.<br><br> Some of its features can be customized.
